.SH NAME
flow-send \- Transmit flow data with the NetFlow protocol.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBflow-send\fR [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-m\fI privacy_mask\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-s\fR ]  [ \fB-x\fI xmit_delay\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-V\fI pdu_version\fB\fR ]  \fB\fIlocalip/remoteip/port\fB\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-send\fR utility is used to transmit flows in NetFlow
format to a collector specified by localip/remoteip/port.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR
Enable debugging.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Display help.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
Enable spoofing of source IP address.
.TP
\fB-m\fI privacy_mask\fB\fR
Apply \fIprivacy_mask\fR to the source and destination IP
address of flows. For example a privacy_mask of 255.255.255.0 would convert
flows with source/destination IP addresses 10.1.1.1 and 10.2.2.2 to 10.1.1.0
and 10.2.2.0 respectively.
.TP
\fB-V\fI pdu_version\fB\fR
Use \fIpdu_version\fR format when transmitting.

\fB-x\fI xmit_delay\fB\fR
Configure a microsecond transmit delay between packets. This may be necessary in some configurations to prevent a transmit buffer overrun.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
.PP
Transmit all flows in the directory /flows/krc4 to the collector at 10.0.0.1
listening on port 9500.
.PP
\fBflow-cat /flows/krc4 | flow-send 0/10.0.0.1/9500\fR
.PP
Generate a test pattern of version 7 flows and send them to a collector at 10.0.0.1 listening on port 9500.
.PP
\fBflow-gen -V7 | flow-send 0/10.0.0.1/9500\fR
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
It is not currently possible to convert between the aggregated formats (8.x)
and the non aggregated formats (1,5,6,7).
