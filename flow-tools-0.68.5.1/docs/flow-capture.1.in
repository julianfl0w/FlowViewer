.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-capture\fR utility will receive and store
NetFlow exports to disk. The flow files are rotated \fIrotations\fRtimes per day
and expiration of old flow files can be configured by number of files
or total space utilization. Files are stored in \fIworkdir\fR
and can optionally be stored in additional levels of directories. Active
files created by \fBflow-capture\fR begin
with 'tmp'. Files that are complete begin with 'ft'.
.PP
When the \fIremoteip\fR is configured only flows
from that exporter will be processed, this is the most secure and recommended
configuration. When the \fIlocalip\fR is configured
\fBflow-capture\fR will only process flows
sent to the \fI localip\fR IP address. If
\fIremoteip\fR is 0 (not configured) flows from any
source IP address are accepted. Multiple non aggregated PDU versions may
be accepted at once to support Cisco's Catalyst 6500 NetFlow
implementation which exports from both the supervisor and MSFC with the
same IP address and same port but different export versions. In this case
the exports will be stored in the format specified by \fIpdu_version\fR or whichever export type is received first.
.PP
NetFlow exports are UDP and do not employ congestion control or a
retransmission mechanism. If the server flow-capture is configured
on is too busy, or the network is congested or lossy NetFlow exports will
be lost. An estimate of lost flows is recorded in the flow files, and
logged via syslog. Most servers will provide a count of dropped packets
due to full socket buffers via the \fBnetstat\fR utility.
For example \fBnetstat -s | grep full\fR will provide a count
of UDP packets dropped due to full socket buffers. If this is a persistent
occurrence either \fBflow-capture\fR will need a larger server
or the compression level should be decreased with -z.
.PP
A SIGHUP signal will cause \fBflow-capture\fR to close
the current file and create a new one.
.PP
A SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal will cause \fBflow-capture\fR to close
the current file and exit.

.TP
\fB-e\fI expire_count\fB\fR
Retain the maximum number of files so that the total file count is
less than \fIexpire_count\fR\&. Defaults to
0 (do not expire).
.TP
\fB-E\fI expire_size\fB\fR
Retain the maximum number of files so that the total storage is less
than \fIexpire_size\fR\&. The letters b,K,M,G can
be used as multipliers, ie 16 Megabytes is 16M. Default to 0 (do not expire).

Select the active definition. Defaults to default.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Display help.
.TP
\fB-n\fI rotations\fB\fR
Configure the number of times flow-capture will create a new file per day.
The default is 95, or every 15 minutes.
.TP
\fB-N\fI nesting_level\fB\fR
Configure the nesting level for storing flow files. The default is 0.
-3 YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD/flow-file
-2 YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD/flow-file
-1 YYYY-MM-DD/flow-file
0 flow-file
1 YYYY/flow-file
2 YYYY/YYYY-MM/flow-file

Configure the process ID file. Use - to disable pid file creation.
.TP
\fB-R\fI rotate_program\fB\fR
Execute \fIrotate_program\fR with the first argument
as the flow file name after rotating it.
.TP
\fB-S\fI stat_interval\fB\fR
When configured \fBflow-capture\fR will log a timestamped
message every \fIstat_interval\fR minutes
indicating counters such as the number of flows received, packets processed,
and lost flows.
.TP
\fB-t\fI tag_fname\fB\fR
Load tags from \fItag_name\fR
.TP
\fB-T\fI active_def\fB|\fIactive_def,active_def...\fB\fR
Use \fIactive_def\fR as the active tag definition(s).
.TP
\fB-u\fR
Preserve inherited umask. By default the umask will be set to 0022.
.TP
\fB-V\fI pdu_version\fB\fR
Use \fIpdu_version\fR format output.
