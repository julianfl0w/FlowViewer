.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
.PP
Provide a report on top source/destination IP pairs sorted by octets, report
in percent total form for the flows in \fI/flows/krc4\fR\&.
Use the preload option to flow-cat to preserve meta information and 
display it with flow-stat.
.PP
\fBflow-cat -p /flows/krc4 | flow-stat -f10 -P -p -S4\fR
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
.PP
Many times a campus network will have a single border router which has
one interface pointing to the internal side and many interfaces pointing
to other providers. These interfaces each have a unique numerical id
known in SNMP terms as an ifIndex. The ifIndex to interface name mappings
can be determined by using a tool such as \fBsnmpwalk\fR
or using show commands in recent versions of IOS with the
\&'show snmp mib ifmib ifindex' or JunOS 'show interfaces'. Once the ifIndex
for each interface is known flow-filter can be combined with flow-stat to
provide reports such as inbound vs outbound top src/destination IP
addresses.
Provide a top source IP address report by outbound traffic, ie the top
senders of traffic on the campus network. Assume the ifIndex of the
campus interface is 5.
.PP
flow-cat -p /flows/krc4 | flow-filter -i5 | flow-stat -f9 -P -p -S3

.PP
Provide a top destination IP address report by outbound traffic, ie the top
sinks of traffic on the campus network. Assume the ifIndex of the
campus interface is 5.
