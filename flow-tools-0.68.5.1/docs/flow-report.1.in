.SH NAME
flow-report \- Generate reports from flow data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBflow-report\fR [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-s\fI stat_fname\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-S\fI stat_definition\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-v\fI variable binding\fB\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-report\fR utility will generate reports
from flow data. The reports are easy to parse ASCII text that
can be used by a front end to produce readable reports, graphs,
and charts.
.PP
Reports are definied in a configuration file by the 'stat-report' keyword
followed by a report name. Each report has a type defined below and other
commands. Reports are grouped into a definition with the 'stat-definition'
keyword followed by a definition name. Each definition can invoke a filter
and optionally apply tags.
.PP
Words in the configuration file of the form @VAR or @{VAR:default} will be
expanded at run-time by setting variable names with the -v option.
.PP
Generated reports consist of comment lines and report lines. Comment
lines begin with a # and include details such as the options used, report
name, records in the report, and the report line format. Some of the
more verbose comments can be controlled with the +header and +xheader
options. By default this information is not displayed. A column title
beginning with the string rec precedes the report lines. Report lines
consist of key fields, such as an IP address and calculated totals
for that key such as the number of flows.
The summary-detail report is a little bit different from other reports
in that it has multiple title lines and no key fields.
The column titles are described below.
.sp
.nf
 +time_real   Difference between the real time of the first and last
              flow.
 +aflowtime   Total time of the flows / Total number of flows.
 +aps         Total Octets / Total Packets (Average Packet Size)
 +afs         Total Octets / Total Flows / (Average Flow Size)
 +apf         Total Packets / Total Flows (Average Packets / Flow)
 +fps         Total Flows / (Last End Time of Flow -
                First Start Time of Flow) (Average Flows / Second)
 +fps_real    (Average Flows / Second in realtime)
 +psizeN      Average Packet Size buckets.
 +fpsizeN     Packets / Flow buckets.
 +fosizeN     Octets / Flow buckets.
 +ftimeN      Time / Flow buckets.

  ignores     Flows with a packet count of 0.

  SSS-count   Count of of an item, example source-ip-address-count

  SSS*        key fields, example source-ip-address
  index       Report line index.
  first       Time of first flow in unix_secs format.
  last        Time of last flow in unix_secs format.

  flows       Summation of flows/key.
  octets      Summation of octets/key.
  packets     Summation of packets/key.
  duration    End time of Flow - Start time of Flow.
  avg-bps     Average Bits/Second.
  min-bps     Minimum Bits/Second.
  max-bps     Maximum Bits/Second.
  avg-pps     Average Packets/Second.
  min-pps     Minimum Packets/Second.
  max-pps     Maximum Packets/Second.
  frecs       Records used in average calculations.

Note fields with a + are only available in the summary-detail report.
.sp
.fi
The PPS and BPS calculations will not always be correct due to flows
which only have one packet, or some other condition where the start
time is equal to the end time. In this case these flows are not
used in the PPS and BPS calculations. To facilitate aggregating
multiple reports and retaining the PPS and BPS fields, the number
of flows counted is available in the frecs field.

.SH "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES"
.PP
Packet size calculations are dOctets / dPkts, ie an average packet size. It
is not possible to get a true packet size from flow exports.
pps and bps calculations are an average of the averages.
Flows that do not have a duration (start == end) are not counted in the
pps and bps calculations.
Flows without a packet or octet count are ignored.
