.SH NAME
flow-cat \- Concatenate flow files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBflow-cat\fR [ \fB-aghmp\fR ]  [ \fB-b\fI big\fB|\fIlittle\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-C\fI comment\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-o\fI filename\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-t\fI start_time\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-T\fI start_time\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-z\fI z_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB\fIfile\fB|\fIdirectory\fB\fR\fI...\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-cat\fR utility processes files and/or directories
of files in the flow-tools format. The resulting concatenated data set is
written to the standard output or \fIfile\fR specified by
\fB-o\fR\&. If \fIfile\fR is a single dash (`-')
or absent, flow-cat will read from the standard input.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Do not ignore filenames that begin with \fItmp\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-b\fI big\fB|\fIlittle\fB\fR
Byte order of output.
.TP
\fB-C\fI Comment\fB\fR
Add a comment.
.TP
\fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR
Enable debugging.
.TP
\fB-g\fR
Sort file list by capture start time before processing.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Display help.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Disable the use of mmap().
.TP
\fB-p\fR
Preload headers. Use to preserve meta information such as lost flows.
.TP
\fB-o\fI file\fB\fR
Write to \fIfile\fR instead of the standard out.
.TP
\fB-t\fI start_time\fB\fR
Select flow files up to \fIstart_time\fR\&. If used with
-T select files between \fIstart_time\fR and
\fIend_time\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-T\fI end_time\fB\fR
Select flow files after \fIend_time\fR\&. If used with
-t select files between \fIstart_time\fR and
\fIend_time\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-z\fI z_level\fB\fR
Configure compression level to \fI z_level\fR\&. 0 is
disabled (no compression), 9 is highest compression.
.TP
\fB\fIfile\fB|\fIdirectory...\fB\fR
Process the files and/or directory.
.SH "TIME/DATE PARSING"
.PP
start_time and end_time parsing is implemented with
\fIgetdate.y\fR, a commonly used function to process free-form
time date specifications. Example usage borrowed from \fBcvs\fR:
1 month ago
2 hours ago
400000 seconds ago
last year
last Monday
yesterday
a fortnight ago

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
.PP
Concatenate all flow files begining with ft-v05.2001-05.01, use 
flow-print to display the results.
.PP
\fBflow-cat ft-v05.2001-05-01.* | flow-print\fR
.PP
.PP
Concatenate flow files in \fI/flows/krc4\fR, store
store the output in \fIcompressed.flows\fR at compression
level 9 (best). The headers are preloaded so various metadata such
as the flow count is correct in the result. Filenames begining with
\fItmp\fR which are typically in-progress flow files
from \fBflow-capture\fR are not processed.
.PP
\fBflow-cat -p -z9 /flows/krc4 > compressed.flows\fR
