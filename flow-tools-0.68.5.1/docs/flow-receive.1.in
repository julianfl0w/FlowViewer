.SH NAME
flow-receive \- Receive flow data with the NetFlow protocol.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBflow-receive\fR [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-b\fI big|little\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-C\fI comment\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-o\fI output_file\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-S\fI stat_interval\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-V\fI pdu_version\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-z\fI z_level\fB\fR ]  \fB\fIlocalip/remoteip/port\fB\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-receive\fR utility is used to receive flows in NetFlow
format. When the \fIremoteip\fR is configured only flows
from that exporter will be processed, this is the most secure and recommended
configuration. When the \fIlocalip\fR is configured
\fBflow-receive\fR will only process flows
sent to the \fI localip\fR IP address. If
\fIremoteip\fR is 0 (not configured) flows from any
source IP address are accepted. Multiple non aggregated PDU versions may
be accepted at once to support Cisco's Catalyst 6500 NetFlow
implementation which exports from both the supervisor and MSFC with the
same IP address and same port but different export versions. In this case
the exports will be stored in the format specified by the -V flag or
whichever export type is received first.

\fB-z\fI z_level\fB\fR
Configure compression level to \fI z_level\fR\&. 0 is
disabled (no compression), 9 is highest compression.

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
It is not currently possible to convert between the aggregated formats (8.x)
and the non aggregated formats (1,5,6,7).
