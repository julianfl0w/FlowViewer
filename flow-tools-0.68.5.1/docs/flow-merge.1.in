.SH NAME
flow-merge \- Merge flow files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBflow-merge\fR [ \fB-aghm\fR ]  [ \fB-b\fI big\fB|\fIlittle\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-C\fI comment\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-o\fI filename\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-z\fI z_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB\fIfile\fB|\fIdirectory\fB\fR\fI...\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-merge\fR utility processes files and/or directories
of files in the flow-tools format. The resulting merged data set is
written to the standard output or \fIfile\fR specified by
\fB-o\fR\&. If \fIfile\fR is a single dash (`-')
or absent, flow-merge will read from the standard input. Unlike flow-cat,
flow-merge interleaves flow records preserving the relative chronological
order.
