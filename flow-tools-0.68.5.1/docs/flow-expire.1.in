.SH NAME
flow-expire \- Manage storage of flow file archives by expiring old data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBflow-expire\fR [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-e\fI expire_count\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-E\fI expire_size\fB\fR ]  \fB-w\fI workdir\fB\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-expire\fR utility will remove the oldest flow files
in a directory based on either a count of files or space utilization. The
directory is recursively searched for flow files. Files that do not have a
flow-tools signature will be ignored. The internal timestamp is used so
backups or copies of the flow files that do not retain the original
timestamp will not impact the operation of \fBflow-expire\fR\&. 
\fBflow-expire\fR is typically used to manage storage in
a distributed environment where flows are collected on a different
server than they are archived.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-d\fI debug_level\fB\fR
Enable debugging.
.TP
\fB-e\fI expire_count\fB\fR
Retain the maximum number of files so that the total file count is
less than \fIexpire_count\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-E\fI expire_size\fB\fR
Retain the maximum number of files so that the total storage is less
than \fIexpire_size\fR\&. The letters b,K,M,G can
be used as multipliers, ie 16 Megabytes is 16M.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Display help.
.TP
\fB-w\fI workdir\fB\fR
Work in \fIworkdir\fR\&.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP

the total storage is less then 2 Gigabytes.
