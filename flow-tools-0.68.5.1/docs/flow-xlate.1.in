.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBflow-xlate\fR utility is used to apply translations
to flows. Translations are defined in a configuration file and are
composed of actions and a definition to invoke action(s). The definitions
are in the form of terms, each term can have a filter and multiple actions.
.PP
Words in the configuration file of the form @VAR or @{VAR:default} will be
expanded at run-time by setting variable names with the -v option.
.PP
Translation actions begin with the xlate-action keyword followed by
a symbolic name. Each action has a type defined below.
.PP
Translation definitions begin with the xlate-definition keyword followed
by a symbolic name. Each definition is composed of terms which are
evaluated in the order of the configuration file. A term may invoke
a filter to conditionally invoke an action.

The scale option can overflow the 32 bit flow counters. This could be
solved by detecting this condition and splitting the flow in two.

Translation between aggregated and non aggregated formats is not supported.
