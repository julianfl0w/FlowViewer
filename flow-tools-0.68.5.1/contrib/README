Cflow:
 Dave Plonka's Cflow perl module.  See http://net.doit.wisc.edu/~plonka/Cflow/

 To properly install Cflow on your system, untar the Cflow archive, cd to the
 Cflow dir, then do:

   perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS='-DOSU' LIBS='-lft'

 This assumes you have flow-tools installed on your system fully, including headers 
 and development libraries. This is the only supported way to use Cflow. Do not
 try to install it as specified in its readme.

 By lack of popular demand, I removed Cflow tarball from the distribution.
 You can download it at the URL above, then build by usual means.

 Those utilities are way too much outdated and do not work.
